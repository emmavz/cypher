**Tokenomics**
Cypher will have its own token (CPHR) that can be aquired through token exchange platforms. Users can convert USDT to CPHR through the smart-contract on ETH, illustrated by the diagram below.

**ETH --> CPHR**

- Theta: the portion of every purchase that goes to the platform. Theta decreases with time as in the beginning, we will need more funding to jumpstart our platform.
- Buying curve: This is the price users purchase CPHR at. Price increases proportionally with time, meaning as the platform gets more popular, the price of each token will increase.
- Selling curve: The selling curve is always lower than the buying curve. This is the price that tokens are sold at. 

Investors will invest by buying CPHR tokens, and holding. They make money by selling them at a higher price (when total supply increases).

**CPHR --> L2 CPHR**

When users aquire CPHR, it is stored in their Metamask wallet. 
- Top-up: To convert CPHR into L2 (Layer 2) CPHR, users will simply log in to Cypher and 'top up' their wallet balance by 'importing' tokens from their Metamask wallet. Once tokens are topped up, they are considered 'Layer 2' CPHR tokens, which allows microtransactions.
- Withdraw: To withdraw CPHR, users will export their L2 CPHR into their Metamask wallet. From there, they can sell (burn) the tokens at a price determined by the bonding curve.

**CPHR --> TEA**

Cypher (the platform) will cover all gas fees from topping up/withdrawing from all users by paying a [monthly] fee to TEA.
