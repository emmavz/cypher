**Cypher uses a 'pay to read/invest' model**



**General:**

When a user wants to read a blogger's article, they will need to execute a transaction with their wallet and pay an amount in **T** to read the TApp's content.

- 20% of the money goes into the bonding curve to be split among the writer and the TApp hosts.
- 10% of the money is split amongst all existing token holders (previous investors), proportionally.
- 70% of the money is invested in the author (bonding curve) through token purchases

**Notes**
- The price to read an article is fixed.
- Articles will become free-to-read in 7 days (concurrent with the life cycle of a blog)

**Upvoting:**

- If a user wants a bigger share in the investing pool to earn more dividends, they have the option to ‘upvote’ authors, which in turn, purchases additional tokens in the bonding curve.

**Cash Out:**

- Users can choose how many tokens to cash out (remove from the investing pool). The exact amount of T depends on the supply at the time of withdrawal. This amount goes into their local wallet.

**Curator Marketing**

There are two ways readers can earn money
1. Holding and selling invested tokens. As supply increases, token prices also increase. As more people invest in the author, either through upvoting or paying-to-read their content, more tokens will be purchased.
2. Dividends. Token holders/investors earn passive income just from holding tokens. As long as people continue paying-to-read the author's content, 10% of their transaction will always be split amongst existing investors.

In this way, the platform is structured in a way to encourage curator marketing. Readers are monetarily incentivised to market for the author, with hopes that more people will pay-to-read/invest so they can benefit.

**Share-to-read**

- Readers who do not want to pay-to-read can access articles another way: by sharing with their network.
- Each article will have its own unique trackable link. When prompted to pay-to-read, users can choose to 'share-to-read' instead, and copy the link and share it with their friends. This creates a 'tree-like' diagram
- When somebody pays-to-read using the link, the article will then be open to everybody in that respective sharing chain.
- As a kickstarter strategy, we will occassionally open articles for free to encourage sharing. The longer the sharing chain is, the more likely the article is to be free.

Notes:
- Each user can only share the link to eight others. This prevents spam and encourages users to choose people who are likely to contribute to the platform
- Each sharing chain can only be eight people long. This prevents grouping (gathering a large gruop of people to only pay once) and keeps the timeframe reasonable
